        I use Vim's built-in <a href="https://vimhelp.org/pi_netrw.txt.html">Netrw</a>
        file browser to browse my files. I've noticed that it's good for most
        things that I use a file browser for.  Occasionally I use a simple
        fuzzy finder, if I'm working on a project and switching between files
        instead of having lots of windows open, but it does require me to know
        the file names ahead of time. Vim being Vim, <em>Netrw has a lot
        keybindings and motions</em>. This is fine, most of the time, because
        you can learn new features as you need them. Sometimes, though, you can
        make mistakes. I can confidently say that all Vim users have experienced
        total confusion at least once in their time using the text editor.

        That being said, Netrw has a feature that allows you to mark files
        within a directory view (marking allows you perform an action on the
        selected batch of files). To mark a file, one can use the
        <code>mf</code> mapping, and to unmark everything, <code>mF</code>.
        I was playing around with this newly learned feature one day, and
        moved on since then.

        A couple of months later, I turned on my printer for the first time in
        a while. It apparently had some things in its job queue to print. It
        printed out 12 pages of seemingly random files and directory listings
        that I used in the past months. In hindsight, 12 pages is not that
        much, but at the time (about two years ago), it felt like it kept going
        and going. This was before I knew of the existance of the
        <em>cancel</em> button it had (new technology, right?). I must've
        accidentally pressed the <code>mp</code> mapping a couple of times.

        Reading the Netrw documentation in the present day with Vim 9.1, I
        cannot find the <code>mp</code> mapping documented anywhere anymore.
        Maybe many others have run into this problem, too, which my silly self
        secretly hopes.
