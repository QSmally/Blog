            For those who are a tiny bit familiar with me, I've been interested
            in microprocessor architectures way before I learned to write
            software. That's about 15 years ago now.  Sometimes, lately, I
            question myself as to why I haven't just bought old CPU components
            earlier.

            As you may or may not know, these architectural designs are over 50
            years old about now. They remain a classic. But, the components are
            quite difficult to find in Europe. I did manage to find a
            retro-style webshop which I purchased used or NOS components from!

            I couldn't find all WDC CMOS versions of the 65-family of ICs, so I
            went with a peculiar combination:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>W65C02S (CMOS, 14 MHz)</li>
            <li>MOS 6522 (NMOS, 1 MHz) 'VIA'</li>
            <li>R6551 (NMOS, 2 MHz) 'ACIA'</li>
            <li>W27C020 (256 KiB) EEPROM</li>
            <li>AS6C62256 (32 KiB) SRAM</li>
            <li>SN74LS00N NANDs</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            Given that I have a 1 MHz crystal oscillator, this runs fine. I'm
            using an LM7805 fixed 5V voltage regulator to power this through a
            9V battery. There's a slight but acceptable voltage drop throughout
            the circuit.
