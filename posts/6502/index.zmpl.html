            For those who are a tiny bit familiar with me, I've been interested
            in microprocessor architectures way before I learned to write
            software. That's about 15 years ago now.  Sometimes, lately, I
            question myself as to why I haven't just bought old CPU components
            earlier.
        </div>

        <p>
        As you may or may not know, these architectural designs are over 50
        years old about now. They remain a classic. But, the components are
        quite difficult to find in Europe. I did manage to find a retro-style
        webshop which I purchased used or NOS components from!

        <p class="text-tiny-section">Part list</p>

        <p>
        I couldn't find all WDC CMOS versions of the 65-family of ICs, so I
        went with a peculiar combination:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li><a href="w65c02s.pdf">W65C02S (CMOS, 14 MHz)</a></li>
            <li><a href="6522-Commodore.pdf">MOS 6522 (NMOS, 1 MHz) 'VIA'</a></li>
            <li><a href="R6551AP.pdf">R6551 (NMOS, 2 MHz) 'ACIA'</a></li>
            <li><a href="W27C020.pdf">W27C020 (256 KiB) EEPROM</a></li>
            <li><a href="AS6C62256.pdf">AS6C62256 (32 KiB) SRAM</a></li>
            <li><a href="sn74ls00.pdf">SN74LS00N NANDs</a></li>
        </ul>

        <p>
        Given that I have a 1 MHz crystal oscillator, this runs fine. I'm using
        an LM7805 fixed 5V voltage regulator to power this through a 9V battery
        or a variable power source. There's a slight but acceptable voltage
        drop of less than 300 mV throughout the circuit. A 1.8432 MHz crystal
        resonator is used for the ACIA to use as baudrate generation.

        <p class="text-tiny-section">Memory map</p>

        <p>
        The memory map of this breadboard computer is similar to
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/BenEater">Ben Eater</a>'s
        architectural design, as it made a lot of sense for this build. It has
        the added benefit to immediately use their
        <a href="https://gist.github.com/beneater/8136c8b7f2fd95ccdd4562a498758217">adapted Apple I Wozmon implementation</a>.
        Ben Eater produces great explanational videos, and is generally a good
        person; I do recommend supporting them and their work.
        </p>

        <p>
        That being said, the memory map consists of:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li><code>0000 - 3FFF : </code>SRAM (16k)</li>
            <li><code>4000 - 7FFF : </code>I/O (16k)</li>
            <li><code>8000 - FFFF : </code>EEPROM (32k)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
        Currently, the I/O space is decoded lazily, with two I/O devices being
        present on the bus:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li><code>5000 - 5003 : </code>6551 Asynchronous Communication Interface Adapter (ACIA)</li>
            <li><code>6000 - 600F : </code>6522 Versatile Interface Adapter (VIA)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
        The NANDs are used for inverting the A15 signal (for active low EEPROM
        enable and used in the I/O enable), I/O enable (low A15 and high A14,
        for enabling the I/O address space), as well as write clock
        synchronisation with the SRAM.

        <p>
        I ran the Wozmon hex monitor on this 6502. The picture lists out
        address range <code>FF00</code> to <code>FFFF</code>, which is the page
        that Wozmon is placed under. The <a href="AppleI_Manual.pdf">Apple I manual</a>
        includes a test program that you can load into RAM and run
        immediately.
        </p>

        <p>
        The breadboard computer is connected through UART (TTL) to my machine
        running Minicom.
