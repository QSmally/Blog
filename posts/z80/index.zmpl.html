            The Z80 architecture is quite special to me. For one, it's the
            processor used in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TI-84_Plus_series">TI-84 plus</a>
            calculator. My <a href="https://qcpu.qsmally.org">initial QCPU 2 architecture</a>
            design is heavily influenced by the Z80, apart from the instruction
            set, before I opted for a full 16-bit RISC V-like architecture.
